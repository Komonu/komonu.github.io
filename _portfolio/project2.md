Our client struggled with performance in their web application built on top of old systems.
Due to this, their customers were complaining and some were even refusing to use the site.

After our engagement, we successfully were able to decrease their website loading times by up to
**9.5X**, significantly enhancing the overall user experience and increasing their customer happiness.


**Speed Boost**: Multiple speed boosts, most notable is a **9.5X** increase which helped turn things around
**Retain Customers**: Thanks to this, customers were no longer leaving the platform and were choosing to go with our clients software
